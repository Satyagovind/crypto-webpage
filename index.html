				Maserati has a history of naming its cars after the world’s most famous winds. It started in 1963 with the legendary Mistral. Then came the Bora and the Khamsin. And recently the Levante joined the illustrious Maserati range.
				The wind that bears its name blows across the Mediterranean and can change from benign calm to gale force in an instant.
